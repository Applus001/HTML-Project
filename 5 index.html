    <h1> Remain Seated</h1>
        <p>It's New York you think to yourself, you know better than to give stranger money. You ignore him. He keeps trying to speak to you, growing more and more frustrated, you see him ball up his fists from the corner of your eye, getting ready to sock you, but you move in time. The stranger hits his hand on the glass of the bus station yelling out in pain. You take that opportunity to grab the stranger by the head and slam it into the glass, knocking him unconscious, you call the cops and they arrive, and take the creep. The bus arrives shortly after the whole ordeal, you get on and go home, just another day in New York you think to yourself. You Win , The End</p>
