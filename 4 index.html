    <h1> Walk over to the Stranger</h1>
     <body> You walk over to him, and he asks if you can spare change so he can get on the bus. You say you don't have any spare change to give him. The stranger gets mad, he balls up his fist and before you know it he socks you in the jaw, knocking you down to the ground. You try to get up, in your rush you're not paying attention, so you slip and hit your head on the pavement knocking yourself unconscious, you are robbed. Mission failed. Try again.
